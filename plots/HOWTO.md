Here you can find the scripts and instructions for reproducing all the figures in my thesis.
I use matplotlib.pyplot for everything described here.
Otherwise, the plots require input data, which is based on the CSV files generated by scripts as described in the top-level [README](../README.md).

# Ratings Overview

This plot shows the a-priori distribution of final player ratings with different colors for DDK, SDK and DAN categories.
It can show the distribution of final rank predictions from any rating system, but in the thesis we use the result of the Glicko-2 system.
Pass the file name to the script `ratings.py`:

```
python3 plots/ratings.py csv/games_glicko.csv
```

# Points Loss Overview

This plot shows the a-priori distribution of points loss per move with different ranking categories.
First, get the rating labels and points loss for every move in the dataset using `datasetviewer`, then pass the file name to the script `ploss_rating.py`:

```
$ datasetviewer/datasetviewer csv/games_labels.csv featurecache
Dataset Viewer: 1890 games read from csv/games_labels.csv (with features), ready.
> dump csv/data-ploss.csv moves rating ploss
Write to csv/data-ploss.csv...
Done.
> exit
Dataset Viewer: bye!
$ python3 plots/ploss_rating.py csv/data-ploss.csv
```
# Winrate Loss Overview

Like the points loss plot, this shows the a-priori distribution of winrate loss per move with different ranking categories. The steps are the same.
First, get the rating labels and winrate loss for every move in the dataset using `datasetviewer`, then pass the file name to the script `ploss_rating.py`:

```
$ datasetviewer/datasetviewer csv/games_labels.csv featurecache
Dataset Viewer: 1890 games read from csv/games_labels.csv (with features), ready.
> dump csv/data-wrloss.csv moves rating wrloss
Write to csv/data-wrloss.csv...
Done.
> exit
Dataset Viewer: bye!
$ python3 plots/wrloss_rating.py csv/data-wrloss.csv
```

# Glicko-2 Confidence

This plot shows how the rating deviation develops over time in our reference Glicko-2 evaluation.
It sources its data from the result as described in the main README, Section “Glicko-2 Calculation”.

```
$ python3 plots/deviation.py csv/games_glicko.csv
```
